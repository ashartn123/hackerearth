You have been given an array of size N consisting of integers. In addition you have been given an element M you need to find and print the index of the last occurrence of this element M in the array if it exists in it, otherwise print -1. Consider this array to be 1 indexed.

Input Format:

The first line consists of 2 integers N and M denoting the size of the array and the element to be searched for in the array respectively . The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of of the array.

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the index of the last occurrence of integer M in the array if it exists, otherwise print -1.


#include<stdio.h>

void main()

{
   
	int N,M;

    	scanf("%d%d",&N,&M);
 
   	int a[N],index=-1;
  
  	for(int i=0;i<N;i++)
   
 	{
    
		scanf("%d",&a[i]);
 
 		if(M==a[i])
        
       
		index=i;
       
        
  
  	}
       
 	if(index==-1)
       
		printf("%d",index);
   
     	else
      
 	{
       
		printf("%d",index+1);
     
  	}
